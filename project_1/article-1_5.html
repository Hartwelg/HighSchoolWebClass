<p>The new image format called "WebP" has much in common with the very widely known jpeg images. WebP images, like jpeg, get lower in quality as you compress them. they are also intended for use on web pages and are supposed to grow in popularity as they become older and older.<br>
<p>WebP is actually supposed to be more efficient than jpeg, though. there is no noticable loss in quality in WebP images (compared to jpeg), even though they take one-third less space than the jpeg. in percentage, WebP is about 39% smaller than the average jpeg, gif, or png.<br>
<p>Google is offering a WebP conversion tool for users to see the difference for themselves. it is available for download on the net right now.<br>
<p>There are no web browsers supporting the new format yet because it is still in the development stage. that means jpeg still has the floor for image formatting. there are high ambitions for this image format, though.<br>
<p>WebP is an image format developed by Google in an effort to have their own image format and to have dominance in the images aspect of the internet. They are also trying so speed up website loading times with their new format. the main thing that makes a web page slow is the images. they take a lot of space, so Google is trying to make things more efficient and less frustrating.<br>
<p>WebP is similar to Google's WebM video format in that WebM is also more efficient with space and quality. WebM had more support when it started, though. WebP is still gaining support and being developed.<br>
<p>In another effort to make things faster, Google has taken the liberty of taking jpeg images on their browser, Google Chrome, and compressing them with the WebP formatting and storing them for later.<br>
<p>There are many things going on in the world of computers and internet. this is one of the big things. within about a year, WebP should have a significant role in image formatting on the internet.<br>
