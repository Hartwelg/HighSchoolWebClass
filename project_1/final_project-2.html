		Dear Parents and Guardians of Salem-Keizer High School Students: 
		<ul>
		<br>
		<font size="2">The Salem-Keizer School Board and District staffs are committed to maintaining an appropriate climate in our high schools.  Our schools are making every effort to be consistent in establishing an acceptable dress code.  The School Board recognizes that a dress code policy enables the District to promote a safe and appropriate educational setting, which is free from unnecessary disruptions or outside influences.  Our main purpose as an educational institution is to assist students in presenting themselves in a manner that promotes a positive and productive school environment, personal pride, and academic success. Students’ dress shall be modest, neat, clean, and in keeping with health, sanitary, and safety practices. To clearly establish this climate, the following are not acceptable:  
		<br>
		<li>Any clothing, jewelry including buckles or items with gang symbols, nicknames, weapons, drug references, profanity or obscene language. </li>
		<br>
		<li>Any clothing or items with racial put-downs, sexually demeaning pictures, words, numbers or sexual innuendo.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Pants designed to sag below the hips will not be allowed.  Pant legs must not drag on the ground.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Belts are to be worn in the belt loops.  No part of the belt should be hanging.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Buckles with any gang, drug/alcohol, tobacco signs or symbols, cut out letters, or numbers.</li>
		<br>
		<li>That which compromises modesty.  Immodest clothing such as halter tops, tube tops, muscle shirts, backless tops/dresses, see-through attire. Clothing that exposes inappropriate areas, including undergarments and midriffs, shall not be worn at school.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Graffiti or gang-related symbols including gang nicknames, drawings or lettering on clothing, notebooks, backpacks or assignments.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Chains such as security and dog chains.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Jewelry items that attract attention and are disruptive to the learning process including spiked jewelry.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Overalls with one or both straps unfastened.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Sunglasses and gloves.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Full-length coats and rainwear inside the school.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Stocking caps, hoods, scarves, hairnets, and bandanas. </li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		*(JCDB – 4 Policy 4.02 establishes that schools may individually expand dress code guidelines.) Individual schools may establish additional restrictions that apply to their schools; we will be working with families and communities on these issues. The intent of this letter is to promote a safe, educational environment for your son or daughter, and to provide some guidance that will be helpful in the selection of school clothing and supplies.  Thank you for your cooperation. </font size="2">

		Kelly Carlisle,
