		<font size="4">Notes for attendance:</font size="4">
		<br>
		<font size="2">If you know what your student will need to leave school early for an appointment, please send a note with them in the morning. your student will take that note to the attendance office in the morning and will be given a pass th leave class at the appropriate time. This helps assure your student will be let out on time an alleviate phone calls to the attendance office. If your student was out sick, please send a note with them when they return to school.</font size="2">
		<br>
		<br>
		<font size="4">Dialer Phone Messages:</font size="4">
		<br>
		<font size="2">South High school has set up dialer systems to communicate important information to parents.The system will try to reach you three times. If you hang up immediately without listening to the message, the system recieves this as an incomplete connection and will try to dial your number again. Please stay on the line to recieve the full, important message.</font soze="2">
		<br>
		<br>
		<font size="4">No student check out after 2:00 pm without a note</font size="4">
		<br>
		<font size="2">Please remember that we do not check students out after 2:00 pm. unless a note has been sent with your student earlier in the day.</font size="2">
		<br>
		<br>
		<font size="4">Notes are not  delivered to  classrooms</font size="4">
		<br>
		<font size="2">If your student has forgotten something or has  asked you to drop off  items for them in the  office please remember  that we do not deliver  notes to the classroom.  Have your student check  in the Main Office if they  have forgotten an item or  expect to have something  delivered. To help insure  items are picked up we  will announce the names  of students with items  dropped off at the end of  class a few times a day.</font size="2">

		<br>
		<font size="2">All Students are assigned a  password for the Intouch  program. Freshman will  receive a new password  within the first few weeks  as passwords do not transfer  from Middle School. This  program allows you to stay  informed of your student’s  grades and attendance.  Ask  your student their user name  and password or bring picture ID to the Main Office  to receive this information.</font size="2">

		<font size="4">Greetings Saxons</font size="4"><br>
		<font size="2">We welcome you to an excellent school filled with Staff who Care about our  students and their education. We welcome you to a school that takes Pride in serving our students, families and  community partners. We welcome you to a school of Action which defines our daily commitment to  being a “School of Excellence.” This will be the second year South has been on a seven period day.  Our office  structure providing services to support families will remain the same except  for our counseling service model. Counseling assignments will be made alphabetically allowing for students to  stay with the same Counselor throughout their high school career. We believe  this model provides a  greater opportunity to build a relationship with your  student and more effectively meet their counseling needs. Families who have  more than one  student will benefit by having the same Counselor.  See page 3  for alpha counselor breakdown. As we prepare to welcome approximately 1,900  students and 138 staff  members, I want to share with you that while we have had challenging  times, I am excited and motivated regarding what  we can accomplish  in the upcoming school year.  With that said, the South High staff  is committed to assisting our students in raising required  reading  and writing scores as measured by state tests. It will take our entire  community of students, parents and staff working together to deliver   success for all Saxons. 
		“Be true to your school” and we will achieve our goals for 2012-2013. Once a Saxon, always a Saxon! 
		We look forward to another great school year.
		Respectfully,
		David Phelps, Principal</font size="2">

		<font size="2"><ol>South High is offering several  options for senior yearbook  pictures. Digital format will  be accepted this year. School  ID pictures may also be used  for the photo in the senior  section unless you choose a  photographer to provide us  with a 2x3 photo by October  31, which meets the following  guidelines:
		<li>2x3 glossy or semi matte (no texture) picture in color (name in pencil on the back) </li>
		<li>No borders</li>
		<li>Head size 1-¼ to 1-½ from top to bottom of chin</li>
		<li>Leave 1/8” between top of head and edge of picture</li>
		<li>Head and Shoulder format only </li>
		<li>No projected background, full length, hats, misty, plants, pets, double exposure or hands included. </li>
		<li>Proper color balance - Pictures need to be in color (no black and white pictures)</li></font size="2">
		</ol>
		<br>
		<br>
		We will try to substitute a school picture for any studio photo that does not meet these guidelines.
