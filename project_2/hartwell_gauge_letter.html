To whom it may concern:
i have been informed that you are reviewing the web pages for your gym. i believe you should use my web page for your gym, not just because it is my web page, but because i think mine is the most complete.<br><br>
my page lists every aspect of the gym and has a schedule for the events. i used a calender from gmail and embedded it into the page for the event times. for the home page, i made a logo and an image map for the links to the other two pages . an image map is an image that has hotspots on it for making links to other websites.<br><br>
i listed all of the events that the gym supports to draw the readers in and to give a complete view of the things they can do. i believe my web page should be the one you use for the gym because it clearly states the things people can do at our gym and it is put together very well in my opinion.<br><br><br>
i put this page together with links between the pages and some resources from outside the page (such as the event calendar) to help with the presentation of it.<br>
